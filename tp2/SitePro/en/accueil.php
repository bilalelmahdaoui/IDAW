      My name is Bilal El Mahdaoui, I am 21 years old and I am currently a general engineering student at the Institut Mines Telecom Lille Douai in the field of "Digital sciences and technologies"
      </p>
      <p>
      I am a student in the framework of the diploma partnership between IMT Lille Douai and my previous engineering school in Morocco: the Mohammed VI International Academy (AIAC), in which I spent 2 years in the Engineering Cycle - Computer Engineering. I am looking for a company that could support me as part of a technical internship lasting 4 to 6 months and that can start from February 1, 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
      In short I would say that what characterizes me the most is creativity and autonomy in learning and problem solving. I'm also someone who appreciates running into problems rather than always having solutions ready, because it allows me to master it well and also to discover other areas.
      </p>
      <p>
      Regarding the para-university side, during my university career, I was able to join different clubs: Enactus, the social club, the Forum AIAC-Entreprises club and finally the IT club, of which I was able to get the post of president and in which I spent some of the best moments of my journey, I learned a lot of things, how to manage a team, manage meetings, how to organize big events, to brand them, and to publicize them properly. - During my free time. I do a bit of sports, digital drawing, photography, I play a bit of music, and I always try to discover new skills and learn them. In fact during the last confinement, I was able to learn a whole new programming language as well as a development framework and with which I worked on personal projects.
      </p>
      <p>
      But over the last 5 years, I have focused on learning concepts of Design: all that is design of graphic visuals and video editing. At the beginning it was just a hobby that I practiced from time to time, but in the last 2 years, I have used my skills to freelance alongside my studies, I have worked with a lot of companies and associations on several projects and they liked the way I work.

        During the last 5 years, I had trained on the Internet and I had learned notions of Graphic Design: all that is design of graphic visuals and video editing. At the beginning it was just a hobby that I practiced from time to time, but in the last 2 years, I have started to use my skills in this area to freelance alongside my studies, I have worked with a lot companies and associations in Morocco on several projects and they appreciated the way I work. So it allowed me to be more financially independent.

      Lately I had this idea of building my own brand that I named "bilaldesignfirm", which is mainly focused on what I did before: the construction of the graphic identity, and the visuals of media coverage on social networks. On top of that, I have also just launched an online store for printed merchandise (T-shirts, hoods, bags, phone cases on the Merch by Amazon, Printify and Redbubble platforms. So what I'm doing? is that I build the design, and the platform supports printing on t shirts.
